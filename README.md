# #Vaccine Sentiment Analysis ðŸ’‰

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic has normalized vaccines to become a part of everyday discourse, as global efforts to increase vaccination rates continue. Considered to have an integral role in managing the pandemic, governments, employers, and other organizations have either implemented or considered vaccine mandates, and this has possibly become the most contentious topic in the last couple of years.

As expected, there are varying opinions about vaccines, which range from their safety or effectiveness, to whether the mandates infringe on human rights. Anti-vaxx sentiments well predate COVID, however given how pervasive vaccine discourse has become, they seem to be on the rise. Understanding the causes and levels of vaccine hesitance is an important first step in addressing the factors that prevent people from getting vaccinated.

For this project, we took to Twitter to gather vaccine sentiments from the beginning of the pandemic to present, in an effort to address the following questions:

* What are the sentiments towards vaccines?
  * Positive, negative, or neutral
* How have these sentiments changed throughout the course of the pandemic, if at all?
  * Do pandemic milestones (e.g. waves, mandates, laws, etc.) impact opinions? 
* What word associations are found with #vaccine?

Data extracted from Twitter will be analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the findings will be visualized on a custom dashboard.

### THE DATA
