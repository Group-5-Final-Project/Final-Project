# Vaccine Sentiment Analysis ðŸ’‰

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic has normalized vaccines to become a part of everyday discourse, as global efforts to increase vaccination rates continue. Considered to have an integral role in managing the pandemic, governments, employers, and other organizations have either implemented or considered vaccine mandates, and this has possibly become the most contentious topic in the last couple of years.

As expected, there are varying opinions about vaccines, which range from their safety or effectiveness, to whether the mandates infringe on human rights. Anti-vaxx sentiments well-predate COVID, however given how pervasive vaccine discourse has become, they seem to be on the rise. Understanding the causes and levels of vaccine hesitance is an important first step in addressing the factors that prevent people from getting vaccinated.
